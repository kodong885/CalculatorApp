# CalculatorApp
This Project is just made for practicing java grammer and Layered Architecture. 

We are going to make CalculatorApp. and let's fiqure out something we have to make. 
## 1. Check Calulator History
## 2. We can compute +, -, x, %.
To implement these funtion, we maybe should add many "if" haha

## 3. Use layered Architecture
I feel like this project is not a big project, but it would be helpful hahah.

### Application Process
1. get a value to be used for calculator ( Main.js ) 
2. pass this value to the Service layer.
3. At the Service layer, we make DTO and pass DTO to the Architecture layer.
4. At the Architecture layer, we are going to use domain object to calculate and store result that domain object made to the List.
