# CalculatorApp
This Project is just made for practicing java grammer and Layered Architecture. 

We are going to make CalculatorApp. and let's fiqure out something we have to make. 
## 1. Check Calulator History
## 2. We can compute +, -, x, %.
To implement these funtion, we maybe should add many "if" haha

## 3. Use layered Architecture
I feel like this project is not a big project, but it would be helpful hahah.
