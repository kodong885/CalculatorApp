# CalculatorApplication 
This project is made just for learning Object-oriented programming (OOP) with Java. 
To make this program, i'm going to set some program process here.

## Setting program process
1. Enter two value of Integer and method to calculate.
2. if user type "stop" or "Stop", this program will stop.

### TMI
Actually, i just tried to build this project using layerd architecture, but i think it's not proper level in this project.
So, i just made this program while following Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles as much as possible.
